# Natdiamonds and Natjewels Filter

## Overview

This project is based on JavaScript and was created to get information about Natdiamonds and Natjewels thanks to the TAP Protocol API Swagger.

[Swagger Documentation](https://fra-01.tap-reader.xyz/docs/json)

The main goal is to know which kind of natstone you have in your wallet and to provide details about each one of them.

This is just a simple code meant to showcase how to call URLs from the Swagger from a local PC.

For production deployment, you will want to launch your own Tapreader node and call the matching API.
